README
======

This application is written in [Silex] (http://silex-project.org/) to show how to use the FormExtension

I use the [Symfony Forms] (http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/book/forms.html) documentation and read the [Silex Extensions] (https://github.com/igorw/Silex/tree/master/src/Silex/Extension) source code to understand how to implement it.

SETUP
=====

All other source code needed are added with <pre><code>git add submodule</code></pre>, just run <pre><code>git submodule update</code></pre> to load all dependencies.

I will update this app with the ValidationExtension when it works for me.

Enjoy !
